<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With some hesitation I have adopted this reading as the one open to least objection, though the balance of authority is decidedly in favour of <em>haud adversa</em>. For the position of <em>tantum</em> cf. Ecl. x. 46, according to the 'subtilior explicatio' now generally adopted.</p><ul><li>412—</li></ul><p><em>Et venit adversi in tergum Sulmonis ibique</em><br><em>Frangitur, et fisso transit praecordia ligno.</em></p><p>The phrase <em>in tergum</em> occurs twice elsewhere: ix. 764—meaning 'on the back'; and xi. 653—meaning 'backward'; and in x. 718 the uncertainty about the order of the lines makes it possible that <em>tergo decutit hastas</em> was meant to refer to the boar, not to Mezentius. But the passages quoted by the editors there shew that the word might be used in the sense of 'shield'; and this being so we are scarcely justified in reading <em>aversi</em> against all the good MSS.</p><ul><li>529—Omitted with most MSS.</li></ul></div> </div>
